# XRPL Metaphysical NFT SDK

Welcome to XRPL-Metaphysical-NFT-SDK, a ground-breaking project that bridges the physical and digital realms by connecting physical garments with digital NFTs minted on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). This repository provides a comprehensive SDK that allows users to embed Near Field Communication (NFC) chips into garments, which are linked to an NFT metadata file stored on Arweave. Furthermore, the SDK offers the functionality to mint NFTs on the XRPL that point to the Arweave metadata.

## Features

- **NFC Chip Integration**: Instructions and code examples for embedding NFC chips into physical garments and encoding the chips with the URL pointing to the NFT metadata hosted on Arweave.

- **NFT Metadata Management**: Comprehensive code for processing NFT metadata and pushing it to the Arweave decentralized storage network.

- **NFT Minting**: Code utilizing the XRPL SDK to mint NFTs that link to the Arweave metadata.

## Getting Started

The XRPL SDK can be installed using npm:

```bash
npm install xrpl
```

## Directory Structure

This project is organized into several key directories:

- `/nfc-integration`: This directory contains all instructions and code related to NFC chip embedding and encoding. 

- `/metadata-management`: This is where you'll find the code for handling NFT metadata and pushing it to Arweave.

- `/nft-minting`: This directory holds the XRPL SDK-based code for minting NFTs that point to the Arweave metadata.
