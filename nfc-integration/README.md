# NFC Integration

Welcome to the NFC Integration directory of XRPL-Metaphysical-NFT-SDK! Here, you'll find instructions and code related to embedding Near Field Communication (NFC) chips into physical garments and encoding these chips with a URL pointing to NFT metadata hosted on Arweave.

## NFC Chip Selection

The choice of NFC chip largely depends on the specific requirements of your project. However, a highly recommended and commonly used NFC chip is the NXP NTAG213. This chip offers sufficient memory (144 bytes), wide compatibility with NFC-enabled devices, and is easily writable using a smartphone.

## Embedding NFC Chips into Garments

Embedding NFC chips into garments is a delicate process that requires precision and care. Here's a simplified guide:

1. Choose the appropriate garment and determine the location for the chip. Ideal locations are easily accessible and do not interfere with the garment's comfort or aesthetics.

2. Prepare the NFC chip. Ensure it is well protected and can withstand the conditions it will be exposed to when embedded in the garment.

3. Using a small tool, such as a seam ripper, carefully create a small opening in the garment at the chosen location.

4. Insert the NFC chip into the opening. Be gentle to avoid damaging the chip.

5. Sew the opening closed, ensuring the chip is secure and not visible.

## Encoding NFC Chips

You will need a smartphone with NFC capabilities to encode the NFC chips. Both iOS and Android platforms offer applications that can handle this task.

**For iOS**: The [NFC Tools](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nfc-tools/id1252962749) app is a great choice. It allows you to read, write, and program tasks on your NFC chips and tags.

**For Android**: The [NFC TagWriter by NXP](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nxp.nfc.tagwriter&hl=en&gl=US) offers an intuitive interface for writing and encoding NFC chips.

To encode the NFC chip with the URL to the NFT metadata, follow these steps:

1. Launch the NFC encoding app on your smartphone.

2. Select the option to write or encode a new NFC chip.

3. Choose the URL/URI option and enter the URL to the NFT metadata hosted on Arweave.

4. Place your smartphone over the NFC chip to begin the writing process. Ensure you maintain contact until the process is completed.

5. Verify the encoding by selecting the option to read the NFC chip. Your smartphone should display the URL you encoded.
