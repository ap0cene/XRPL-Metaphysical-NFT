# XRPL Metaphysical NFT SDK

#### This repo is a work in progress, and work on this protocol is on-going

Welcome to XRPL-Metaphysical-NFT-SDK, a ground-breaking project that bridges the physical and digital realms by connecting physical garments with digital NFTs minted on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). 

<a href="https://nft.ap0cene.com/" target="_BLANK">You can read a more in depth article about how we're integrating this technology into the ap0cene fashion marketplace here</a>

This repository provides a comprehensive SDK that allows users to embed Near Field Communication (NFC) chips into garments, which are linked to an NFT minted on XRPL, with token metadata listed on Arweave. 

## Features

- **NFC Chip Integration**: Instructions and code examples for embedding NFC chips into physical garments and encoding the chips with the URL pointing to the NFT metadata hosted on Arweave.

- **NFT Metadata Management**: Comprehensive code for processing NFT metadata and pushing it to the Arweave decentralized storage network.

- **NFT Minting**: Code utilizing the XRPL SDK to mint NFTs that link to the Arweave metadata.

## Getting Started

The XRPL SDK can be installed using npm:

```bash
npm install xrpl
```

## Directory Structure

This project is organized into several key directories:

- `/nfc-integration`: [Read about NFC Integration](nfc-integration/README.md) 

- `/src/arweave.js`: This is where you'll find the code for handling NFT metadata and pushing it to Arweave.

- `/src/mint.js`: This file holds the XRPL SDK-based code for minting NFTs that point to the Arweave metadata.
